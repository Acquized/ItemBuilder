# Contribution
First, thanks that you want to contribute. This here is a Guideline how to contribute to this Project.  
  
### Issues
If you want to contribute and fix an Issue, **first** open a Issue and write in it that you want to fix it yourself, then wait for a reply from a contributer. Maybe he has already fixed your problem.

### Pull Requests
1. First, if you never submited a Pull Request, read the Guide **[here](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)**.

2. Clone the Repo locally to your computer
3. Make changes locally and push them to a **different** branch on your local repo.
4. Push it to GitHub. For the Commit Message, see at the end of the file.
5. Sumbit a Pull Request and wait for Contributors to merge / close your Pull Request.  
  
### Commits
* Use present tense & imperative mood.  
  [✔] "Add Feature"  
  [✖] "Added Feature"  
  [✖] "Adds Feature"  
* Consider starting the Commit Message with a Prefix in [] Characters. Here is a list:  
  `[B]` » Fixing Bug  
  `[F]` » Implementing Feature  
  `[P]` » Fixed Performance Issues  
  `[C]` » Code Cleanup  
  `[D]` » Writing Docs  
  * You see it as example in this Files Commit Message.  
* When fixing Bugs / implementing Features, include the Issue Number. This will automaticly close the Issue.  
  [✔] "Fixes #245" (for Issues)  
  [✔] "Resolving #820" (for Suggestions)  
  [✖] "Fixed bug with Constructor Material found in #245"  
* When you want to fix a Bug / implement a Feature suggested on the [Spigot Page](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/itembuilder.16786/), write the Username prefixed with an S so i can reply to the User:    
  [✔] "Add Suggestion from S-Acquized"  
  [✖] "Add Suggestion from Acquized and implemented a Auto Destroy" (yes i know i did it, i won't do it anymore okay)  
* Make your Commit Message short and do not include nonsense - A bigger Description can be added in the Description Message  

### The last Word
* Pushing into the `gh-pages` or `master` Branch and submiting a Pull Request is **forbidden**. The master branch contains the Code that is published on Spigot and the gh-pages Branch contains the JavaDocs.

Thanks for reading, have a nice day.
